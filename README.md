# java-collections
![Release](https://jitpack.io/v/JustJoost/java-collections.svg)
(https://jitpack.io/#JustJoost/java-collections)

At present just a circular buffer I once needed, and still do occasionally. Basically just here for personal storage, but anyone is welcome to use it/improve it. Include in your project by adding:

maven { url 'https://jitpack.io' }

under 'allprojects/repositories' in your top level Gradle build file, and:

implementation 'com.github.JustJoost:java-collections:1.0'

under 'dependencies' in your module Gradle build file
